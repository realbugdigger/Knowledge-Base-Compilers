# What is assembler?

An **assembler** is a type of computer program that interprets software programs written in assembly language into machine language, code and instructions that can be executed by a computer. The assembler enables software and application developers to access, manage, and control hardware and system operations.

In other words, an assembler translates a low-level language, assembly language -- that show more human-readable than machine language, but less than high-level languages like C, C++, Java, etc -- into a set of machine-level instructions that can be executed directly by the computer's CPU.

Here are a few key points about assemblers:

- **One-to-one translation**: Typically, each assembly language instruction corresponds to a single machine language operation, which gives programmers detailed control over the computer's behavior.
- **Symbolic reference handling**: Assemblers can handle symbolic references, allowing programmers to refer to memory locations by labels instead of raw addresses.
- **Macro support**: Some assemblers support macro instructions, which are shorthand for series of instructions.
- **Types of Assemblers**: There are two types of assemblers based on how many passes over the source code they take to produce the machine language program: a single-pass assembler and a multi-pass assembler.
- **Performance:** Code written in assembly language is generally faster and requires less memory than code written in a high-level language, but it is also more difficult to understand and debug.

While modern operating environments favor high-level languages, assembly language is still used for programming tasks where extreme efficiency, real-time performance or access to specific hardware features is necessary.
