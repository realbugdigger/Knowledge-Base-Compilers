# What is a loader

The Loader is part of an operating system and is responsible for loading programs from executable files into memory, preparing them for execution, and then executing them.

Functions of Loader:

- Loading: It loads the executable module prepared by the linker into the main memory for execution.

- Linking: It links the program with other programs needed for its execution such as library files.

- Relocation: It modifies the absolute program to make it run at a different location. It does this by adjusting the relocation constants of a program.

- Allocation: It allocates space for programs in the memory. It also protects the program and data from being modified by other programs.

The main difference between Linker and Loader is the part of programming process they are involved in - Linker combines object files created by compiler into an executable program, while Loader loads this executable program into memory for execution.
